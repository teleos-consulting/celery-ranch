"""
Celery Ranch - A Celery extension for fair task scheduling with LRU prioritization.

Celery Ranch provides a way to fairly distribute tasks among multiple clients using
Least Recently Used (LRU) prioritization. This prevents high-volume clients
from monopolizing worker resources.

Basic usage:
    from celery import Celery
    from celery_ranch import lru_task

    app = Celery('tasks')

    @lru_task(app)
    def process_data(data):
        # Process data
        return result

    # Using LRU prioritization - "client_id" is the LRU key
    result = process_data.lru_delay("client_id", data_to_process)
